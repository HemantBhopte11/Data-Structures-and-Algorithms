🧱 Phase 0: C++ Basics (Foundation)

Must-know before DSA

Input/Output (cin, cout)

Data types, loops, conditionals

Functions & recursion

Pointers & references

STL basics

vector, pair, map, set

stack, queue, priority_queue

sort, lower_bound, upper_bound

👉 Goal: Be comfortable writing clean C++ code fast.

🔁 Phase 1: Time & Space Complexity

Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ

Best / Worst / Average case

Recursion stack space

👉 Very important for interviews

📦 Phase 2: Arrays & Strings

Array traversal

Prefix sum

Sliding window

Two pointers

String manipulation

Hashing basics

Practice problems

Reverse array

Maximum subarray (Kadane)

Two Sum

Longest substring without repeating characters

🔗 Phase 3: Linked List

Singly & Doubly linked list

Fast & slow pointers

Reverse linked list

Detect cycle

Merge two sorted lists

📚 Phase 4: Stack & Queue

Stack using array / linked list

Queue & circular queue

Monotonic stack

Next Greater Element

Stock Span

Valid Parentheses

🌳 Phase 5: Trees

Binary Tree basics

Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

Level order traversal

Height / Diameter

Binary Search Tree (BST)

👉 Very high interview weight

🧮 Phase 6: Recursion & Backtracking

Basic recursion patterns

Subsets / permutations

N-Queens

Sudoku solver

Rat in a Maze

🧠 Phase 7: Hashing

unordered_map, unordered_set

Frequency counting

Subarray sum = K

Longest consecutive sequence

🔺 Phase 8: Heap / Priority Queue

Min heap / Max heap

K largest / smallest elements

Merge K sorted arrays

Median in a stream

📊 Phase 9: Graphs

Graph representation (Adj list)

BFS & DFS

Cycle detection

Topological sort

Shortest path

BFS

Dijkstra

Bellman-Ford

🧩 Phase 10: Dynamic Programming (🔥 Most Important)

Memoization vs Tabulation

1D DP (Fibonacci, Climbing stairs)

2D DP (LCS, Knapsack)

DP on strings

DP on grids

👉 Take this slowly and deeply

⚙️ Phase 11: Advanced Topics

Bit manipulation

Tries

Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)

Segment Tree (optional but powerful)

🧪 Phase 12: Practice Strategy

Platforms

LeetCode

GeeksforGeeks

CodeStudio

Codeforces (for logic building)

Rule

🟢 Easy → 🟡 Medium → 🔴 Hard

Solve 300–500 problems for strong confidence
